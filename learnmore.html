    <h3><i>We believe you should control your data.<br>
         That’s why we’ve designed AllSafe so that we can't see the information you store in it.<br>
          The happy consequence?<br>
          Unlike a lot of tech companies, we don’t make money by selling your data. <br>
           And unlike keeping your passwords and personal info in some dark, mysterious cupboard in your browser, with Allsafe, you have easy access to everything on any device.<br>
           
        
        You don't have to trade Big Tech convenience for privacy and peace of mind.<br>
        <u>AllSafe gives you both.</u>
